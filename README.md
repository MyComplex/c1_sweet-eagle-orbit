## Scope of Work

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. is a modest SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing firm with big dreams. I've been contracted to review their existing website codebase for opportunities to improve accessibility and perform a bit of code maintenance. As a result of the work performed, Horiseon should also expect a boost in search rankings.
